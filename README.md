#Welcome to Critical Mass

##Overview
**Critical Mass** is an Android application that allows you to easily explore what is happening in the surroundings, join the events you like, and avoid crowds if you want.

*Critical Mass is a software development project for HMC CS121.*

##Inspiration

Dining halls get crowded easily at the 5Cs, but people are busy with life. This great idea is from our client team members Will Marks, Kevin Nguyen, and Archer Wheeler, and is implemented by Tingyu Huang, Ruoxi Lu, Huakai Liao, Xin Xin.

##Design philosophy

We have designed it to be simple, objective, and concise, letting the user making his or her decisions without any unnecessary influences.

To find out what an event looks like, the user can choose to read through the comments made by other users. 

##Features

###Mass event on the map!
All the events will show on the map view, with markers the size of which indicates the number of participants at the event.
###List them all!
What to get it all at once? No problem. Critical Mass has an event list view that lists the events happening around you.
###What people are talking about
You can view other participants' comments about each mass event and make an informed decision.

>Note that this is the only way you get subjective information from Critical Mass, as we want to keep unnecessary influences on your decision making as few as possible.

###Leave a comment

Like it or not, leave a comment! You can choose to sign up and log in to Critical Mass, or you will be assigned a unique ID to keep a consistent profile when using Critical Mass. However, your comments will be anonymous regardless.

##FAQ

###1. Will my location always show on the map?

No. Your location will only show on the map if you have opened the app **and** you have permitted us to get your geo location. 

>Note that you can only see others' location if you have granted Critical Mass the permission to get your location info.
	
###2. Can I create my own event?

No.
    
###3. I think instant messaging services would be really cool!
